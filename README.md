## Description 

This project enhances an existing Kanban board application by adding secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The goal is to create a secure and user-friendly experience for accessing and managing tasks. Users must log in to access the Kanban board, and their session will expire after a period of inactivity.
